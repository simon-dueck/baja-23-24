# BAJA INSTRAMENTALS 23-24

## Currently working on: 
- GPS, Time, Display 
  * Having issues with the screen and the data displying 
  * Have to re-order new displays

## Planned to Implement:
- GPS, Time, Distance - (Should be done by Oct 21)
- Accelerometer data - (1 Month)
- Implement a Fan for the powertrain - (2 weeks)
  * Operated either by temp or battery voltage
- Better implemention of 4WD - (1-2 Weeks)
  * On the steering wheel if possible with a fail-safe
- Fuel 
   * Will use time with testing data (2 days)
   * If we have extra time then we will look into other ideas
   * Perphas a static pressure port from a tee which results in no extension of the fuel line (1 month)
- Check for wheel speed (2-3 weeks)

## Sensors Implemented
- Adafruit Ultimate GPS (Absolute positioning @ 10hz)

## Sensors to be Implemented
- MPU6050 Accelerometer (Body and Upright Accelerations)
- SN-04 NPN Inductive sensors (Wheel speeds)
  
## OTHER IDEAS
- "Sleep mode" to turn itself off
- Measuing Oil temps
- Control the differential, CVT fans, and the brake lights
